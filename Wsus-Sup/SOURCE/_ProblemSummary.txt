Summary of Reported Symptoms (in order)
1.	Initial Issue
o	SCCM Software Update Point (SUP) in QA and Prod stopped syncing monthly updates.
o	Errors observed: Sync failed: WSUS server not configured. Please refer to WCM.log for configuration error details.. Source: CWSyncMgr::DoSync
o	WCM.log showed: System.Net.WebException: Unable to connect to the remote server ---> System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it :8531
2.	Network Check
o	Test-NetConnection confirmed port 8531 responds, so network connectivity was fine.
3.	Registry Review
o	WSUS registry indicated:
	UsingSSL=0 (SSL disabled)
	PortNumber=8530 (HTTP)
o	SCCM SUP was trying to connect via HTTPS (8531), causing mismatch.
4.	WSUSService Behavior
o	Get-Service wsusservice → service not found.
o	sc query wsusservice → “Access Denied.”
o	Task Manager showed WsusService.exe running, but:
	Service not visible in services.msc.
	Cannot be managed via PowerShell or SCM.
o	Indicates WSUSService process exists but is detached from Service Control Manager.
5.	WSUS Console
o	WSUS console would not launch because WSUSService was not running (or not registered).
o	When accessible, WSUS was misconfigured to sync from itself instead of Microsoft Update.
6.	Repeated Remediation Attempts
o	WSUS and SUP roles were removed and re-added multiple times in both QA and Prod.
o	Postinstall often failed with: Cannot open WSUSService service on computer '.'. Access is denied
o	Even after reinstall, WSUSService remained unmanageable.
7.	Database Status
o	SUSDB was intact and on the same server.
o	Last month’s sync was successful, confirming WSUS worked previously.
8.	Microsoft Engagement Findings
o	Root cause: WSUS misconfiguration and incomplete cleanup.
o	Full teardown and cleanup required:
	Remove WSUS features and roles.
	Delete WSUS registry keys, folders, IIS sites, SUSDB.
	Fix permissions on %windir%\Temp and ASP.NET temp folders.
	Recreate missing registry entries under HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Update Services\Server\Setup.
	Run wsusutil postinstall from commandline.
o	After this, SUP sync resumed successfully.
9.	Current State
o	Production SUP is syncing now, but WSUSService still:
	Cannot be queried or controlled via SCM.
	Exists only as a running process.
o	Concern: After reboot or next sync cycle, WSUS will break again because service registration is corrupted.
________________________________________
Key Underlying Problem
•	WSUSService is not properly registered with SCM despite the binary running.
•	This prevents normal management, health checks, and postinstall tasks.
•	Repeated WSUS reinstalls without full cleanup leave orphaned registry entries and broken ACLs.
•	SCCM and WSUS console depend on a healthy WSUSService for long-term stability.
