There are multiple Patch My PC licensing tiers (Patch, Plus, and Premium).
 There are two deployment models: the on-premises Publisher and the cloud-based SaaS version. 
 Our environment uses Intune + SCCM + Patch My PC Publisher for endpoint patching.
 Servers still rely on SCCM-SUP. 
 We discovered a GPO applying two expired certificates to the affected servers.
 One labeled “PatchMyPC” and the other “WSUS”—which do not appear to come from the Publisher configuration. 
 Both certificates share the same expiration date and are expired.
 They may originate from a previous or attempted Patch My PC Cloud or standalone WSUS integration. 
 Question: Could these expired, GPO-deployed certificates conflict with our current SCCM–Intune–Patch My PC Publisher setup and contributing to the WSUS/SUP failures described earlier?
